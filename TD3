# Exercise 1: Grep and awk on tabular data
# 1. Display the list of files and folders at the root using ls -l
ls -l /

# 2. In a pipeline (using |), append a grep instruction to only display informations of bin
ls -l / | grep "bin"

# 3. Append an awk instruction to only display the size of bin
ls -l / | grep "bin" | awk '{print $5}'

# 4. Now rather extract the month, day and year of creation of the folder bin
ls -l / | grep "bin" | awk '{print $6, $7, $8}'

# 5. Now rearrange the instruction to get the following output format : 2020-Oct-26 (from original data : Oct 26 2020)
ls -l / | grep "bin" | awk '{printf("%s-%s-%s\n", $8, $6, $7)}'

# Exercise 2: Grep with Regex, and sed on unstructured data
# 1. Run the following command :
curl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cyberattacks > cyberattacks.txt

# 2. Use grep to extract all the lines that contain the keyword "meta"
grep "meta" cyberattacks.txt

# 3. Now only extract "meta" and the first following word. You might use grep options to enable the use of regex (Regular Expressions) 1
grep -oP "meta\s+\w+" cyberattacks.txt

# 4. Only extract the following word (but not the keyword "meta")
grep -oP "(?<=meta\s)\w+" cyberattacks.txt
